# Git work flow  

- `master` branch is the main branch
- Can't push directly to `master`  - Only PR (Pull Request)
- Every feature/issue should be a new branch and requires a PR (pull request)
- Each PR must be approved by a person on the `@code-reviewer` team who is not part of the PR
- Every PR should be referencing an issue
